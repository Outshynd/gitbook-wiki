## Overview

This section will provide an overview of the various guides and approaches to server setup.

The Windows version will have a few more options than the Linux version. Simply because using Docker is the simplest thing to do on Linux.

Choose only **one** of the options, whatever suits you the best.

## Windows

### [**Regular server setup**](windows-setup/regular-setup/) **(with port forwarding)**

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a server on your Windows PC using only Windows. Aside from MO2 and/or VMM, there will be no additional software.&#x20;

I would only use this option if you are familiar with port forwarding and/or have done it **numerous times** before.

### [**ZeroTier server setup**](windows-setup/zerotier-setup/) **(without port forwarding)**

This guide will walk you through the process of installing ZeroTier on your Windows PC.&#x20;

While ZeroTier may appear intimidating at first, the guide will walk even the most inexperienced user through both hosting a server and connecting to the server with ease!

## Linux

### [**Docker setup**](linux-setup/docker-setup.md) **(with portforwarding)**

This guide will walk you through the process of installing a server on your Linux PC using Docker.

Only the Linux terminal will be used in this guide.

#### Onwards to the next step!
