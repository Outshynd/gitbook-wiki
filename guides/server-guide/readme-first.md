# ReadMe first

## Preliminaries

Just to set the expectations at a reasonable level, please read this page.

### **This guide will:**

1. Assume that you've followed every previous step of this guide.
2. Use paths from this guide and this guide only.
3. Use MO2 as the mod manager.
4. Try and show you different methods/options on how to host your server.
5. Cover both how to setup your server on a Windows based machine and a Linux (Ubuntu) based machine.
6. Keep being as user-friendly, and try and guide you as to the best of my ability.

### **This guide will not:**

1. Cover how to do port-forwarding in any depth, other than to show you how it looks in my personal router setup
2. Offer support on how to fix your router

## Expectations

1. Hopefully, this will work for the majority of you.
2. But, there's a possibility that it won't work for everyone.
3. Everyone's system is different in some way, which means this guide can't possibly help everyone.
4. I expect that you read this guide as thoroughly as you can.

#### With that being said, let's go :thumbsup:
