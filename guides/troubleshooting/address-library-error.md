# Address Library error

## Q: I get all types of errors regarding the address library

There are several different causes for the "address library not loading" error. This page covers those, and how to solve it.

### Wrong address library version

You need to install **All in one (Anniversary Edition)**, not **All in one (Special Edition)**.

### Skyrim 1.5

You used the downgrade patcher, and are running Skyrim Special Edition 1.5. If you did, go to steam, and verify Skyrim's game files to install the latest version of Special Edition, 1.6.

### Wrong game selection

When you launched Skyrim Together for the first time, you did not select SkyrimSE.exe when the selection popped up. You can fix this by going to SkyrimTogether.exe and double clicking it while holding spacebar. This should reopen the selection menu. Select **SkyrimSE.exe** this time.

### **Mod Organizer 2**

Go to Mo2, right click Address Library for SKSE Plugins, open file explorer, once there - copy the SKSE folder, go to **\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data**, and paste the SKSE folder into the **DATA FOLDER.**

### Other

If you still get this error, check the path located at the bottom of the error, and verify that address library is actually installed there.

## Any of that didn't work for me, what do I do?

If nothing of that worked for you, you can [re-do this guide](../getting-started.md). Then it definitely should work. It's been tested thoroughly and will work for most people.
