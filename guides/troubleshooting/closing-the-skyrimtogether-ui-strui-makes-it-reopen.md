# Closing the SkyrimTogether UI (STRUI) makes it reopen

## Q: When I'm trying to close the STRUI, it just reopens

**A:** Instead of `Right CTRL`, try using the `F2` button.

**A:** If that doesn't work, reload your savegame and/or restart your game. It may be necessary to restart several times.

**A:** If you're using ModOrganizer2 (MO2), you can also try deleting everything in MO2's overwrite folder, which can be found here:\
`C:\Modding\MO2\overwrite`
