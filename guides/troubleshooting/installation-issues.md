# Installation issues

### Game not loading

Make sure you selected SkyrimSE.exe during the fist startup. You can reselect it by opening SkyrimTogether.exe while holding spacebar. Alternatively, make sure that you have clean skyrim ini files. Delete your INI files in "**Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition**" and launch Skyrim through Steam once to regenerate vanilla INI files.
