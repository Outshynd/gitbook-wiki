# Gameplay issues troubleshooting

### Enemies not dying

Some enemies might not die if they were killed by a kill move. Install this mod to disable kill moves, essentially solving this issue: [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13395](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13395)

### Crashing on connect

We are not sure what causes this yet exactly, but one possible cause is custom skyrim INI files. Delete your INI files in "**Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition**" and launch Skyrim through Steam once to regenerate vanilla INI files.

### UI not showing

If the UI does not load, or the screen is covered with white boxes when pressing right control, exit to the main menu and load your save again. If that does not work, try restarting your game until it works.
