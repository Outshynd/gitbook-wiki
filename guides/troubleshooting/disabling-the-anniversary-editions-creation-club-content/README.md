# Disabling the included Creation Club content

{% hint style="info" %}
When Bethesda released the Anniversary Edition DLC, they updated the game to v1.6.

In that update, they included 4 Creation Club items.

These CC items have shown to make the Skyrim Together Reborn experience more unstable.

This guide will show you how to remove the included CC content, either using MO2 or VMM.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Removing the Creation Club content might make your existing savegame(s) unloadable.

Regardless of that, it's still highly recommended to remove them!
