# Getting Started

{% hint style="warning" %}
Reading the [playguide](../general-information/playguide.md) is **as essential** as the installation itself. It takes one minute to read. Please take the time to do so, as it will help you in the dozens of hours you might be playing this mod.
{% endhint %}

### Supported versions

To play Skyrim Together Reborn, you must use Skyrim Special Edition 1.6 on Steam. You do not need the Anniversary Upgrade paid mod pack. In fact, we recommend playing without it. The VR, console, Legendary and Gamepass editions are **not** supported. Neither is Skyrim Special Edition 1.5 (aka pre Anniversary update). To make sure you have the latest update of Special Edition installed, verify the game files through Steam.

To see the full list of Supported games and versions, visit [this page](../general-information/supported-games.md).

### ReadMe before installing!

This will be a guide that will get Skyrim Together Reborn up and running, with only the required mods included. Main reason is, that mods can make things difficult with Skyrim Together Reborn. Refer to [this](../general-information/faq.md#q-can-i-use-other-mods-with-this-mod) and [this](../general-information/faq.md#q-will-x-mod-work-with-this-mod) for the reasons why.

The **most important thing** is that all your users/friends/players will use the exact same mods in the exact same load order. So if all your players have followed **this guide** and **ONLY** this guide, you should be somewhat fine. But again, refer to [this](../general-information/faq.md#q-can-i-use-other-mods-with-this-mod) and [this](../general-information/faq.md#q-will-x-mod-work-with-this-mod) - it might not work perfectly.

This guide will try and include as many screenshots and GIFs as possible, and be as user-friendly as possible. This means that it will include all necessary steps to get Skyrim Together Reborn up and running.

Whenever the guide refers to "SkyrimSE", it's just short for Skyrim Special Edition.

### Guides:

{% hint style="warning" %}
The guide uses either MO2 or Vortex as the mod manager.

Both mod managers has their own separate guides.
