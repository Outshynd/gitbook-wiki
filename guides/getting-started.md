# Getting Started

{% hint style="warning" %}
Reading the [playguide](../general-information/playguide.md) is **as essential** as the installation itself. It takes one minute to read. Please take the time to do so, as it will help you in the dozens of hours you might be playing this mod.
{% endhint %}

For the easiest and most complete installation, watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ogIhWUxPyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ogIhWUxPyE)

### Supported versions

To play Skyrim Together Reborn, you must use Skyrim Special Edition 1.6 on Steam. You do not need the Anniversary Upgrade paid mod pack. In fact, we recommend playing without it. The VR, console, Legendary and Gamepass editions are **not** supported. Neither is Skyrim Special Edition 1.5 (aka pre Anniversary update). To make sure you have the latest update of Special Edition installed, verify the game files through Steam.

### Installation

{% hint style="warning" %}
The below instructions are for those who are fairly experienced modders already. If you are not very good at modding or computers, we **highly** recommend you watch the installation video instead: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ogIhWUxPyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ogIhWUxPyE)

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you haven't ran Skyrim Special Edition prior to this installation, do it now.

[If you are using MO2, follow the Mod Organizer 2 installation guide!](mod-organizer-2.md)
{% endhint %}

To install Skyrim Together Reborn, we recommend you use a mod manager like Vortex or Mod Organizer 2. The mod requires another mod to load, [Address Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444?tab=files). You need to download the **All in one (Anniversary Edition)** version. Use the "**Mod Manager Download**" button to install it with your mod manager of choice. You can download Reborn [on nexus here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69993).

Once the mod is installed and enabled, you can find **SkyrimTogether.exe** in your Skyrim game folder. This can be found at `Data/SkyrimTogetherReborn/SkyrimTogether.exe`. You can either configure your mod manager to add a launch button for this executable, or you can create a desktop shortcut by right clicking it.

When you launch the mod for the first time, it will most likely ask you to find `SkyrimSE.exe`. If it did not automatically find the correct folder and you do not know where this is, go to Steam, right click "**The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition**", click "**Manage**", and click "**Browse local files**". Copy the location of this over to the prompt.

To open the UI, either use the Right-CTRL key or the F2 key.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do **NOT** select SkyrimSELauncher.exe! If you did, or if you made another wrong selection, hold spacebar and double click SkyrimTogether.exe . This allows you to reselect your game.
