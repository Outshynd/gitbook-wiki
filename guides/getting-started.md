# Getting Started

{% hint style="warning" %}
Reading the [playguide](../general-information/playguide.md) is **as essential** as the installation itself. It takes one minute to read. Please take the time to do so, as it will help you in the dozens of hours you might be playing this mod.
{% endhint %}

### Supported versions

Skyrim Special Edition v1.6 on Steam is **required** to play Skyrim Together Reborn. The Anniversary Upgrade paid mod pack is not required. In fact, we recommend that you play without it. The VR, console, Legendary, and Gamepass editions are incompatible. Skyrim Special Edition 1.5 is not supported either (aka pre Anniversary update). Verify the game files through Steam to ensure you have the most recent Special Edition update installed.

To see the full list of Supported games and versions, visit [this page](../general-information/supported-games.md).

This will be a guide to getting Skyrim Together Reborn up and running with only the required mods.

The main reason is that mods can complicate things with Skyrim Together Reborn. For more information, see [this](../general-information/faq.md#q-can-i-use-other-mods-with-this-mod) and [this](../general-information/faq.md#q-will-x-mod-work-with-this-mod).

This guide will attempt to include as many screenshots and GIFs as possible, with the goal of being user-friendly. This means it will include all of the steps required to get Skyrim Together Reborn up and running.

When the guide refers to "SkyrimSE," it simply means "Skyrim Special Edition."

### Guides:

{% hint style="warning" %}
The guide uses either MO2 or Vortex as the mod manager.

Both mod managers has their own separate guides.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
You must first launch Skyrim Special Edition via Steam before you can begin! This only needs to be done once.
