4. Press `Log in`
5. If Vortex fails to redirect you to the authorization page, you can go back to the Vortex client, and there'll be a popup like so, where you can copy the URL needed:\

6. Regardless of a successful redirect or not, you'll be met with a page, where you need to select `Authorize`:\

7. Vortex should now pop up, asking if you want to contribute `Diagnostics & usage data`. You can choose whether to `Allow` or `Deny` it, that's up to you:\
