4. Press `Log in`
5. If Vortex fails to redirect you to the authorization page, you can return to the Vortex client and a popup will appear with the URL you need:\

6. Whether the redirect is successful or not, you will be taken to a page where you must select `Authorize`:\

7. Vortex should now pop up, asking if you want to contribute `Diagnostics & usage data`. You can choose whether to `Allow` or `Deny` it, that's up to you:\
