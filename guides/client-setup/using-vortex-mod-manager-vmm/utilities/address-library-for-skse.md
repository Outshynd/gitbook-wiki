# Address Library for SKSE

{% hint style="danger" %}
It's **NOT** required to use Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) to play Skyrim Together Reborn!
{% endhint %}

Even though the name of the mod is `Address Library for SKSE`, we don't actually need SKSE installed.&#x20;

But we **do** need to install this mod, for Skyrim Together Reborn to work.

## Downloading and installing Address Library

1. Head to the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444?tab=files), find the `All in one (Anniversary Edition)` version and press `Mod Manager Download`
2. ![](https://shx.is/5BiWbFFPM.png)
3. Vortex should now launch and download the mod.
4. It's that simple.
