# Before we begin

## A few notes before we begin playing!

1. Every time you want to play Skyrim Together Reborn, you must use the custom launcher we made in ModOrganizer2/MO2.
2. When you first launch Skyrim Together Reborn, you should create a NEW CHARACTER. When playing Skyrim Together Reborn, it is recommended that you only use that character and savegame.
3. You **MUST** finish the first Helgen mission before attempting to connect. Otherwise, things will go wrong for you, and you may have to restart with a new savegame.
4. Bugs should be expected. There are [numerous bugs](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/TiltedEvolution/issues). This will not be a smooth, MMO-like experience in which everything "just works." Remember, they're a group of volunteers doing this in their spare time for free.
5. If you want to contribute to the mod's development, we are always looking for **C++ coders** and people with **reverse engineering** skills for the mod, and **Angular/TypeScript coders** for the mod's UI. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/skyrimtogether) and introduce yourself.
6. If you don't know how to code but still want to help, please report your bugs and discoveries [here](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/TiltedEvolution/issues). Use the template; it exists for a reason. If you truly want to help fix the bug, be as thorough as possible.
